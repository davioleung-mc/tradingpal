# Combining MACD and RSI for More Powerful Trading Signals

![MACD and RSI combined indicator analysis showing dual momentum confirmation signals with MACD crossover patterns and RSI trend strength levels for enhanced trading accuracy across crypto, forex, and equity markets](/img/macd-rsi.png)

## Overview
MACD spots momentum shifts and trend direction; RSI measures the strength and “speed” of moves. Combining them helps filter false signals and time entries with better probability across crypto, gold, FX, and equities.

## What each indicator does (quick refresher)
- MACD(12,26,9): bullish when MACD line crosses above signal and preferably above 0; bearish when it crosses below and/or below 0.
- RSI(14): bull bias when above 50, bear bias below 50. Use 40–60 as a trend ribbon; 30/70 are exhaustion zones. Divergences warn of reversals.

## Core combo strategy (rules you can copy)

### Trend filter
- Use a 200 EMA on price to avoid choppy ranges.
  - Longs only if price closes above 200 EMA.
  - Shorts only if price closes below 200 EMA.

### Entry (on candle close)
- Long:
  - MACD line crosses above Signal AND histogram ≥ 0
  - RSI crosses above 50 (ideally rebounding from 40–50 zone)
- Short:
  - MACD line crosses below Signal AND histogram ≤ 0
  - RSI crosses below 50 (ideally rolling down from 50–60)

### Stops and targets
- Initial stop: 1.5×ATR(14) beyond entry or beyond the last swing.
- Take profit:
  - Scale at +1R; trail remainder with 2×ATR or the 20 EMA.
  - Or exit on opposite MACD crossover or RSI crossing back through 50.

## Optional confirmations
- Multi-timeframe: trade on 1H/4H only when the higher timeframe RSI is on the same side of 50 and MACD histogram agrees.
- Zero-line rule: favor MACD signals near or crossing the zero line—often stronger trends.

## When to avoid
- Price pinned near the 200 EMA (range).
- Major event risk minutes before/after CPI, FOMC, NFP, ETF decisions.

## Cheat sheet (at-a-glance)

| Condition     | Long                            | Short                          |
|---------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Trend (200 EMA) | Close above                   | Close below                    |
| MACD           | Cross up, histogram ≥ 0       | Cross down, histogram ≤ 0      |
| RSI            | Crosses above 50 (prefer 40→50→up) | Crosses below 50 (prefer 60→50→down) |
| Stop           | Entry − 1.5×ATR or under swing | Entry + 1.5×ATR or above swing |
| Exit           | +1R scale, trail; or opposite cross | +1R scale, trail; or opposite cross |

## Worked examples (hypothetical)
- BTCUSDT, 4H
  - Setup: Price above 200 EMA; MACD crosses up; RSI crosses 50 from 47.
  - Entry: 62,800; ATR(14)=420 → Stop = 62,170.
  - 1R target: 63,430; partial take profit; trail with 2×ATR.

- XAUUSD (Gold), Daily
  - Setup: Above 200 EMA; MACD cross up near zero; RSI 52 and rising.
  - Entry: 2,360; ATR=28 → Stop = 2,318.
  - Scale at 2,402; trail using 20-day EMA or 2×ATR.

## Settings that work well
- Intraday (5–15m): MACD(24,52,9), RSI(14), 200 EMA; expect more noise.
- Swing (1H–4H): MACD(12,26,9), RSI(14); sweet spot for crypto and FX.
- Daily: Defaults or faster MACD(8,21,5) for earlier signals.

## Add a high-probability pattern: divergence + trigger
- Bullish: Price lower low while RSI makes higher low; wait for MACD cross up and RSI reclaim >50.
- Bearish: Price higher high while RSI makes lower high; then MACD cross down and RSI <50.

## Common mistakes
- Entering before candle close (signals can vanish intra-bar).
- Taking every RSI 70/30 reading as reversal—combine with MACD and trend.
- Oversizing; keep risk ≤1%.
- Ignoring higher-timeframe context.

## Backtesting quick plan
- Pick a pair and timeframe (e.g., BTC 4H).
- Test 100 trades across market regimes.
- Track win rate, average R, profit factor, max drawdown, longest losing streak.
- Include realistic fees/slippage; use signals only at bar close.
