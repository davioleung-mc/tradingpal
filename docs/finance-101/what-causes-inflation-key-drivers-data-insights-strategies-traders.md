# What Causes Inflation? Drivers, Data, and How Traders Can Position

## Overview
Inflation is a sustained rise in the general price level. It usually emerges from a mix of strong demand, constrained supply, easy money/credit, and rising inflation expectations. For traders, inflation shifts central-bank policy, real yields, and cross-asset correlations—moving crypto, gold, oil, bonds, and equities.

## Key takeaways
- The big four: demand-pull, cost-push, money/credit growth, and expectations.
- Measurement matters: core vs headline (energy/food), shelter components, and trimmed-mean indexes.
- Watch real yields and breakevens: Nominal yield ≈ Real yield + Expected inflation (Fisher).
- Rising inflation tends to favor commodities (gold/oil) and short-duration assets; disinflation favors longer-duration growth and bonds. Crypto’s response depends on liquidity and real yields.

## How inflation is measured
- CPI: Consumer Price Index (headline and core).
- PCE: Fed’s preferred gauge in the US (core PCE is stickier).
- PPI/Import Prices: Upstream cost pressures.
- Trimmed-mean/Median CPI: Noise-reduced measures of persistence.
- Breakeven inflation: Market-implied inflation from TIPS vs Treasuries.

## The main causes of inflation (and what to track)

### Demand-pull (too much money chasing too few goods)
- Causes: Fiscal stimulus, low rates, strong employment/wealth effects.
- Data to watch: Retail sales, services PMI, unemployment rate, consumer credit growth.
- Trading lens: Can lift risk assets initially; persistent overheating pressures bonds and long-duration tech.

### Cost-push (rising input costs)
- Causes: Energy shocks (oil/gas), shipping bottlenecks, tariffs, rising wages, supply-chain disruptions.
- Data to watch: Oil and gas prices, Baltic Dry/Container rates, PPI, unit labor costs, import prices.
- Trading lens: Bullish commodities; squeezes margins in cost-sensitive sectors.

### Money and credit conditions
- Causes: Rapid growth in money supply (M2), QE/liquidity injections, easy bank lending; velocity matters.
- Rule of thumb: %ΔM + %ΔV ≈ %ΔP + %ΔY (Quantity Theory). If money/velocity grow faster than real output, prices tend to rise.
- Data to watch: M2 YoY, bank lending standards, credit growth, financial conditions indices.
- Trading lens: Loose conditions can buoy crypto and high beta; tightening flips the script.

### Inflation expectations and wage-price dynamics
- Causes: Households/firms expecting higher prices, bargaining for raises—can reinforce inflation.
- Data to watch: 1y/5y consumer expectations (UMich), 5y5y breakevens, Atlanta Fed Wage Tracker.
- Trading lens: Sticky expectations keep core services inflation high; boosts real-asset hedging demand (gold, RWAs).

### Currency depreciation and import pass-through
- Causes: Weaker domestic currency raises import prices.
- Data to watch: DXY/NEER, import prices, current-account balances.
- Trading lens: EM FX weakness can fuel local inflation; bullish local-currency commodities, bearish long-duration bonds.

### Structural factors
- Causes: Housing shortages, demographics, de-globalization, regulation, market concentration.
- Data to watch: Shelter CPI/OER, vacancy rates, building permits, trade restrictions.
- Trading lens: Shelter is sticky and often dominates core inflation prints.

### Taxes and administered prices
- Causes: VAT hikes, fuel taxes, subsidy removals, utility price resets.
- Data to watch: Government policy calendars; regulated tariff announcements.
- Trading lens: Can spur short-term headline spikes without changing trend.

### One-off shocks
- Causes: Wars, pandemics, natural disasters.
- Data to watch: Geopolitical risk indexes, commodity supply disruptions.
- Trading lens: Volatility and flight to quality (USD, gold); watch energy curves.

## Case study: 2021–2023
- Demand: Reopening + fiscal transfers boosted consumption.
- Supply: Ports/shipping snarls; energy shock in 2022.
- Money/Credit: Rapid 2020–21 liquidity, then sharp tightening in 2022–23.
- Outcome: Headline CPI spiked, then fell as supply normalized and policy tightened; core/shelter lagged.

## Trader’s checklist (next 3–6 months)
- Are breakevens rising while real yields fall? Pro-risk, supportive of gold/crypto.
- Is oil > key cost thresholds with low inventories? Persistent cost-push risk.
- Are wages outpacing productivity? Stickier core services inflation.
- Are financial conditions easing (credit spreads tighter, DXY weaker)? Inflation impulse can re-accelerate.

## Playbook: positioning ideas (educational, not financial advice)

### Rising inflation/rising breakevens:
- Overweight: commodities (oil, copper), gold, value/cash-flow equities, short-duration credit, selective RWAs.
- Rate-sensitive hedges: TIPS vs nominal Treasuries; steepener trades.
- Crypto: Bitcoin sometimes behaves like “digital gold” when real yields fall and liquidity is flush. Watch funding and real-yield trend.

### Falling inflation/disinflation:
- Overweight: long-duration bonds, growth tech, quality factor.
- Crypto: Liquidity and real yields dominate—disinflation with dovish policy is typically supportive.

## What doesn’t automatically cause inflation
- Money supply alone when velocity collapses (e.g., 2008–2013).
- Wage growth matched by productivity gains.
- “Greedflation” narratives without tight capacity or demand pull—markups can contribute but are rarely the sole driver.

## FAQs
- Why do central banks hike rates against inflation? To cool demand and credit, lifting real yields and anchoring expectations.
- Why does “core” exclude food and energy? To strip volatile components and see the underlying trend.
- How fast do rate hikes affect inflation? With long and variable lags—often 6–18 months.
