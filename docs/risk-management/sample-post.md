# Position Sizing: a practical starter

Position sizing is the single most important technique for keeping your trading account alive. This short guide explains a practical, conservative approach you can start applying today.

## Why position sizing matters
A good position-sizing rule prevents a single trade from wiping out the account. It turns a stream of wins and losses into a sustainable process by limiting downside on each trade.

## A 1% risk-per-trade rule (conservative)
- Decide how much of your account you're willing to risk per trade — a conservative starting point is 0.5–1%.
- Calculate position size: Position Size = (Account Size * Risk %) / (Entry Price - Stop Price)

Example: account $10,000, risk 1% ($100), entry $50, stop $48 → risk per unit = $2 → buy 50 units.

## Practical tips
- Use stop-loss orders at meaningful technical levels (support, moving average, structure).
- Size down when volatility increases.
- Keep a trading journal and track drawdowns.

## Quick checklist
- Risk per trade set (start 0.5–1%)
- Stop placement defined
- Position size calculated
- Journal entry saved
