# Risk Management Index

Welcome to our comprehensive risk management resource center. Proper risk management is the foundation of successful contract trading.

## üéØ Core Risk Management Principles

Risk management in contract trading involves identifying, assessing, and controlling potential risks that could result in financial losses. It's about maximizing profit opportunities while minimizing downside risk.

### The 2% Rule
Never risk more than 2% of your trading capital on a single trade. This fundamental rule helps preserve your capital for long-term success.

### Risk-Reward Ratios
Always aim for a minimum 1:2 risk-reward ratio, meaning you should target at least $2 in profit for every $1 you risk.

### Position Sizing
Calculate your position size based on your risk tolerance and stop loss distance, not on how much you want to make.
