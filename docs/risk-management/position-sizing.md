# Position Sizing

Learn how to determine the optimal position size for each trade to maximize profits while managing risk effectively.

## Coming Soon

This detailed guide on position sizing is under development. Topics will cover:

- **Position Sizing Methods**: Fixed dollar, percentage, volatility-based
- **Kelly Criterion**: Mathematical approach to optimal sizing
- **Risk-Based Sizing**: Calculating size based on stop distance
- **Portfolio Heat**: Managing total risk across multiple positions

## Quick Calculator

While we develop the full guide, use our [Position Size Calculator](/tools/calculator) for quick calculations.

## Key Principles

1. **Risk Per Trade**: Never risk more than 1-2% per trade
2. **Account for Leverage**: Calculate actual risk, not position size
3. **Volatility Adjustment**: Smaller positions in volatile markets
4. **Consistency**: Use systematic approach, not gut feeling
