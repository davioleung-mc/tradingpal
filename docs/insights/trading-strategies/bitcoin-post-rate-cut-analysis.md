# Bitcoin Post-Rate Cut Analysis: Short-Term Volatility Ahead, Deeper Correction on Horizon

**By Broker Market Insights | September 18, 2025**

In the wake of the Federal Reserve's anticipated 25 basis point interest rate cut, Bitcoin (BTC) has exhibited classic signs of indecision on the daily chart, forming a long-legged doji candle that reflects the market's tug-of-war between bulls and bears. As the cryptocurrency hovers around $115,000–$117,000, technical indicators point to an imminent pullback, potentially offering savvy traders a window for repositioning. This analysis draws from recent chart patterns and momentum signals to outline short-, medium-, and long-term expectations for BTC's trajectory.

## Short-Term Outlook: Distribution Zone and Liquidity Sweeps

The daily timeframe reveals a clear distribution phase at current highs. Following a sharp post-crash rally, BTC has reached the upper Bollinger Band, signaling overextension. The Stochastic RSI has entered overbought territory, underscoring heavy long positioning that could trigger a near-term washout.

Expect a dip to the Bollinger Band midline around $112,000–$113,000 within the next 24 hours. On the 4-hour chart, this aligns with the lower boundary of an ascending expansion pattern (widening wedge), which has been tested multiple times. Historical behavior suggests a brief divergence here—potentially dipping slightly below the trendline to trigger stop-losses and induce capitulation among leveraged longs—before a reflexive rebound.

This setup could manifest as a "stop hunt" followed by a liquidity grab at the upper resistance near $118,000, calculated via Fibonacci retracement (0.618 level from the recent high to low at approximately $117,950). Such a double-fakeout would clear out both downside and upside liquidity, paving the way for a more decisive move lower. Traders should monitor volume spikes and RSI divergence for confirmation, with $112K acting as a key support to watch for any bullish reversal.

## Medium-Term Scenario: Wedge Breakdown and ABC Correction

Zooming out, the current structure resembles a classic ascending wedge within a broader impulsive wave. A breakdown from this pattern targets $92,000–$98,000, including a retest of the CME gap at $91,800. This would complete an ABC corrective wave, with the ongoing drop as Wave A, a potential B-wave bounce to $110,000–$111,000, and Wave C extending toward the aforementioned targets.

The head-and-shoulders top formation adds bearish conviction: the left shoulder at prior highs, the head at $120,000+, and the emerging right shoulder around $118,000. A neckline break could accelerate selling pressure, flipping market sentiment from optimistic to cautious. Above $110,000 remains structurally bullish in the long run, but sub-$100,000 levels would test retail resolve.

| Key Levels     | Description                          | Implication                                      |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| $118,000      | Upper Resistance (Fib 0.618)        | Liquidity sweep target; failure here signals weakness |
| $112,000–$113,000 | Bollinger Midline / Wedge Support   | Short-term dip zone; break below eyes $110K     |
| $92,000–$98,000 | Wedge Breakdown Target              | Medium-term correction floor; CME gap fill      |
| $110,000–$111,000 | ABC Wave B Potential                | Rebound zone before final leg lower             |

## Long-Term Perspective: Accumulate for November Dip

Despite the bearish tilt, the macro environment post-rate cut echoes 2020 dynamics, where monetary easing fueled a prolonged bull run. However, BTC's current overbought state suggests a healthy reset before resuming upward momentum. A deeper correction to $67,000–$70,000 by November 2025 aligns with historical post-easing patterns and offers an attractive entry for long-term holders.

Analyst Jimmy 米哥, a prominent trader, echoes this view, having scaled out of positions above $120,000 (with an average cost basis in the mid-$60,000s) to build cash reserves. He advocates patience, urging investors to accumulate below $70,000 for the next leg higher into 2026. This "last chance" dip could shake out weak hands while rewarding disciplined strategies like dollar-cost averaging.

## Conclusion: Navigate with Caution, Eyes on $112K

BTC's immediate path favors volatility over direction, with a probable test of $112K–$113K providing clarity. While short-term bears hold the edge, the bigger picture remains constructive above $110K. Risk management is paramount—tight stops above $118K for shorts, and scale-ins below key supports for longs. As always, monitor macroeconomic cues like upcoming Fed commentary and on-chain metrics for shifts in sentiment. For traders eyeing leverage, high-rebate platforms can offset costs in this choppy environment.
