# Personal Finance Tips

Build a solid financial foundation for successful trading.

## Essential Financial Principles

### 1. Emergency Fund First
Before trading, establish an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses.

**Why It Matters:**
- Protects your trading capital
- Reduces emotional trading decisions
- Provides financial security

**How to Build:**
- Start with $1,000 minimum
- Automate monthly contributions
- Keep in high-yield savings account

### 2. Budget for Trading
Only trade with money you can afford to lose.

**The 50/30/20 Rule:**
- 50% - Needs (rent, food, utilities)
- 30% - Wants (entertainment, dining out)
- 20% - Savings & Investments (including trading)

### 3. Debt Management
Pay off high-interest debt before aggressive trading.

**Priority Order:**
1. Credit card debt (>15% interest)
2. Personal loans
3. Student loans
4. Mortgage (last priority)
