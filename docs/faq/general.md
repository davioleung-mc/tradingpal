# Frequently Asked Questions - General

## Getting Started

### Q: What is contract trading?

**A:** Contract trading involves significant risk due to leverage and complexity. Beginners should:
- Start with education and demo accounts
- Begin with small position sizes
- Focus on risk management
- Consider starting with spot trading first

### Q: How much money do I need to start contract trading?
**A:** While some platforms allow starting with as little as $100, we recommend:

- **Recommended**: $5,000-$10,000 for flexibility
- **Never invest more than you can afford to lose**

### Q: What's the difference between contract trading and stock trading?
**A:** Key differences include:
