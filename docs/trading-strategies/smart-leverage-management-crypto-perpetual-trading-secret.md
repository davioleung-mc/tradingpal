## Overview
Leverage multiplies outcomes by lowering the cash needed to open a position but does not reduce risk—risk is controlled by position size and stop placement. These 10 “secrets” will help avoid liquidation traps, fee drains, and cascading losses while trading BTC/ETH, majors, and RWAs on perpetual contracts.

## Key idea
Survival > returns. Use leverage to express a view efficiently, not to gamble.

## Leverage multiplies losses faster than you think
- Approximate adverse moves to wipe initial margin:
  - 3x → ~−33%
  - 5x → ~−20%
  - 10x → ~−10%
  - 20x → ~−5%
  - 50x → ~−2%
  - 100x → ~−1%
- Action: Keep leverage ≤ 3–10x for directional trades with stops far from liquidation.

## Risk is defined by your stop, not leverage
- Position size (units) = Risk $ ÷ Stop distance $ per unit
- Required margin = (Position size × Entry price) ÷ Leverage
- Leverage affects margin posting, not dollar loss when stopped.

## Example
- Account $10,000; risk 1% = $100.
- BTC entry $63,000; stop $62,370 (−$630).
- Units = 100 ÷ 630 ≈ 0.1587 BTC; Notional ≈ $10,000.
- At 10x leverage margin ≈ $1,000. Loss if stopped ≈ $100 (1%).

## Isolated vs Cross Margin
- Use Isolated margin to contain losses to one position.
- Cross margin backs all positions with full account; riskier for beginners.

## Liquidations use Mark/Index price, not Last price
- Stops/liquidations can trigger even if last-trade price doesn’t hit your level.
- Display mark/index price on charts and place stops with buffers.

## Funding and fees can silently bleed you
- Funding paid on full notional, not margin.
- Example: $10,000 notional, 0.05% funding per 8h = $5 every 8h; 0.5% of $1,000 margin per 8h.
- Use limit maker orders and avoid rich funding costs.

## Maintenance Margin and Auto Deleveraging (ADL)
- Liquidation occurs when margin ≤ maintenance margin + fees.
- ADL can close profitable positions if insurance funds are insufficient.
- Larger positions on illiquid assets have higher MMR and ADL risk.
- Know MMR tiers on your exchange; keep liquidation buffers.

## Liquidity and slippage matter
- Thin books + high leverage = slippage/stops.
- Avoid trading illiquid assets or low-volume times.
- Size orders carefully using impact cost tools.

## Correlated bets create hidden leverage
- E.g., long BTC + ETH + SOL is one big macro bet.
- Track total portfolio delta and sector exposures.

## Use bracket orders and reduce-only flags
- Always set stop and take-profit (OCO/bracket).
- Reduce-only prevents accidental position flips.
- Scale out profits: partial take at +1R, move stop to breakeven, trail rest.

## Start small and build stats
- Begin with 2–3x leverage and risk 0.5–1.0% per trade.
- Log at least 50–100 trades before increasing size.
- If max drawdown >10%, halve size; >20%, pause and review.

## Pre-trade checklist (60 seconds)
- Trend: Price vs 200 EMA aligns?
- Volatility: ATR sufficient? Stop ≥ 1–1.5×ATR.
- Signal: Confirmed candle close (e.g., MACD/RSI)?
- Margin mode: Isolated, leverage ≤ 5–10x, stop far from liquidation.
- Costs: Funding acceptable? Use limit orders.
- Order safety: Bracket/OCO set, reduce-only checked, quantity verified.

## Simple liquidation sanity check
- For USDT perps, ignoring fees/MMR:
  - Long liquidation ≈ (1/leverage) below entry.
  - Short liquidation ≈ (1/leverage) above entry.
- Add buffer for fees and MMR; use exchange calculators.

## Worked mini-scenarios
- Directional swing long (BTC): Risk 1%, 4H chart, 7x leverage, stop 600 away.
- High-leverage scalp (ETH): 25x leverage, stop 0.8% away; risky with wicks and fees.

## When NOT to use leverage
- Near major news events.
- Low liquidity or illiquid assets.
- Without predefined stops and max loss limits.
- To chase losses.

## Quick fee and funding math
- Break-even move ≈ (Fees + Funding) ÷ Notional.
- Hold 48h, funding 0.03%/8h + taker fees ≈ needs ~0.21% price move to break even.

## Starter rules to copy
- Max risk/trade: 0.5–1%; max daily loss: 2–3%, then pause.
- Max leverage: BTC/ETH ≤ 10x; alts ≤ 5x; raise only after proven stats.
- Always use isolated margin; stop distance ≥ 1–1.5×ATR; liquidation buffer ≥ 3× stop distance.
- Cap holds or hedge if funding > 0.05%/8h against you.
