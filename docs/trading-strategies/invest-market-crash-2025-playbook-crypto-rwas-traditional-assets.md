# What to Invest If the Market Crashes in 2025? A Practical Playbook for Crypto, RWAs, and Traditional Assets

## Overview
Market crashes aren’t one-size-fits-all. Outcomes depend on what triggers the drawdown: recession/deflation, inflation shock, or a liquidity/credit event. This guide maps each scenario to assets that historically hold up best, how to hedge with crypto and RWAs, and a rules-based plan to deploy capital before, during, and after a selloff.

## TL;DR positioning ideas (educational, not financial advice)
- Safety and dry powder: short-term Treasuries/T-bills (or tokenized T-bills), high-quality money market funds, USD/stablecoins with diversified custody.
- Inflation hedge: physical gold or tokenized gold, TIPS, broad commodities.
- Liquidity/volatility hedge: long volatility (VIX calls), put options, partially short index futures/perps.
- Opportunistic risk: staged buys in BTC/ETH, quality equities, and select RWAs once panic indicators peak and breadth stabilizes.

## Crash scenario map

| Crash trigger             | What usually happens              | Assets that tend to help                              | What to be careful with                  |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Deflationary recession     | Yields fall, credit spreads widen, earnings drop | Long-duration Treasuries, investment-grade bonds, gold, defensive equities; later: quality growth | Highly levered cyclicals; small caps early in the drawdown |
| Inflation shock           | Yields rise, real incomes squeezed | Gold, commodities (oil/copper), TIPS, short-duration bills, value/energy | Long-duration bonds; unprofitable growth |
| Liquidity/credit event    | USD spikes, everything correlates to 1 | Cash/T-bills, USD, long volatility, tactical shorts; tokenized T-bills on-chain | Carry trades, altcoins with thin liquidity |

## Crypto and RWA toolset you can actually use
- **Cash and near-cash:** Short-term Treasuries/T-bills (1–6 months) or tokenized T-bills (RWA).
- **Stablecoins:** Diversify across issuers/custody; monitor depeg risk.
- **Inflation hedges:** Gold (physical, ETFs, tokenized), TIPS, broad commodities.
- **Volatility and downside hedges:** Index puts, VIX calls, short futures/perps; crypto protective puts or short perps.
- **Opportunistic risk:** DCA or staged buys in BTC/ETH, quality equities, tokenized RWAs.

## Signals to watch before deploying risk
- Credit stress and spreads.
- Volatility washout (VIX behavior).
- Market structure (indexes, breadth).
- Liquidity (DXY, stablecoin/ETF inflows).
- Crypto-specific signals (funding rates, on-chain flows).

## A simple, rules-based crash plan

### Pre-crash (now)
- Build safety bucket: 6–12 months runway in short T-bills/tokenized T-bills.
- Add structural hedges: 5–10% gold; small rolling puts or VIX calls; define max hedge budget.
- Set staggered buy limits at 10%, 20%, 30% below current levels.
- Position sizing rule: risk ≤1% equity per trade; use ATR-based stops.

### During the crash
- Avoid averaging down blindly; buy after confirmation signals.
- Rotate to cash-generative, low-debt names; avoid thin liquidity alts.
- Use hedges tactically; roll winners, avoid over-hedging.

### After the panic
- Reduce hedges as breadth improves; DCA into beta.
- Rebalance to targets (Gold 7%, T-bills 20–30%, core equity/crypto).
- Consider factor shifts from defensives to cyclicals/small caps.

## Example allocations to consider testing (non-advice, illustrative)

| Scenario              | Allocation                                                                                          |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Defensive tilt        | 30% T-bills/tokenized T-bills, 10% Gold, 10% TIPS, 20% Global defensives, 15% BTC/ETH, 10% Long vol, 5% Cash |
| Inflation-shock tilt  | 25% T-bills, 12% Gold, 10% Broad commodities, 10% TIPS, 18% Quality value equities, 15% BTC/ETH, 10% Hedges |

## How to implement (step-by-step)
- Set up portfolio buckets: Safety, Hedge, Risk, Opportunity.
- Automate DCA schedules and GTC laddered buys.
- Use alerts for credit spreads, DXY, VIX, 200-day MA.
- Hedge discipline: cap hedge spend, roll on schedule, size for drawdown buffering.
- Recordkeeping: track entries, signal/reason, exit criteria.

## Crypto-specific crash tactics
- Basis trades: long spot BTC/ETH, short perp for funding.
- Stablecoin diversification: across issuers/chains; custody vs exchange wallets.
- On-chain yield with caution: prioritize short-duration, transparent RWAs.

## Common mistakes to avoid
- Going all-in early; crashes have multiple legs.
- Fading strong trends without confirmation.
- Concentrating stablecoins or RWAs with one custodian.
- Ignoring currency risk; USD spikes can hurt non-USD portfolios.
- Letting hedges lapse as volatility rises.

## FAQs
- Should I sell at first -10%? Rarely wise; build rules-based hedge/buy framework instead.
- Is gold guaranteed to rise in a crash? No, but it historically holds value, especially as real yields fall.
- What about long bonds? Helpful in recessions with falling yields; hurt in inflation shocks.
- Is crypto a hedge? Crypto drops with risk assets in liquidity panics; recovers strongly in easing liquidity.
