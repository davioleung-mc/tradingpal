## Overview
DCA is a simple, proven way to invest by buying a fixed dollar amount of an asset on a regular schedule (weekly/monthly), regardless of price. It reduces timing risk, smooths volatility, and builds discipline—ideal for beginners allocating to crypto, gold, stocks, or tokenized RWAs.

## Key takeaways
- Buy more when prices are low and fewer units when prices are high.
- DCA lowers the impact of bad timing and volatility but doesn’t guarantee profits.
- Lump-sum investing often wins over very long horizons in rising markets; DCA trades some expected return for lower risk and smoother ride.
- Automate the plan, control fees, and predefine rules for rebalancing and exits.

## What DCA is (and isn’t)
- Is: Fixed contributions on a fixed cadence into chosen assets or portfolios.
- Isn’t: Market timing or chasing dips; it’s a rules-based habit compounding over time.

## Who DCA is for
- New investors wanting to remove emotion from entries.
- Builders of positions in volatile assets like BTC/ETH, gold, ETFs, tokenized RWAs.
- People with steady income who can automate contributions.

## The 10-step DCA plan
1. Define your goal and horizon (e.g., 3–5 year core position in BTC, gold, global ETFs).
2. Pick assets and weights (starter: 60% crypto, 20% gold, 20% equity ETF).
3. Choose cadence and amount (monthly or biweekly, sustainable amount).
4. Select venues and custody (reputable exchanges, self or custodial).
5. Minimize fees and slippage.
6. Automate funding and buys.
7. Park cash between buys in short-term T-bills or tokenized equivalents.
8. Set guardrails like max position sizes and pause/resume rules.
9. Rebalance quarterly or semiannually.
10. Track contributions, prices, fees, units, average cost; review regularly.

## Worked example: 6-month BTC DCA

| Month | BTC Price | Contribution | Fee (0.10%) | Net Invested | BTC Bought |
|-------|-----------|--------------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| 1     | 60,000    | 500          | 0.50        | 499.50       | 0.008325   |
| 2     | 54,000    | 500          | 0.50        | 499.50       | 0.009250   |
| 3     | 48,000    | 500          | 0.50        | 499.50       | 0.010406   |
| 4     | 52,000    | 500          | 0.50        | 499.50       | 0.009606   |
| 5     | 58,000    | 500          | 0.50        | 499.50       | 0.008612   |
| 6     | 63,000    | 500          | 0.50        | 499.50       | 0.007937   |

- Total contributed: $3,000; fees: $3; total BTC ≈ 0.05414
- Average cost per BTC ≈ $55,400
- Portfolio value at $63,000 BTC ≈ $3,410, outperforming lump sum at $60,000.

## Important notes
- Lump-sum often beats DCA in long bull markets.
- DCA minimizes regret and volatility, not maximizes returns.

## How to build a simple DCA calculator (Sheets)
- Columns: Date, Price, Contribution, Fee rate, Net Invested, Units Bought, Cumulative Units, Cumulative Cost, Average Cost.
- Use formulas for net invested, units bought, and average cost.

## Advanced variations
- Value Averaging: Adjust buys to hit target portfolio values.
- Volatility booster: Increase buys after dips >10% below 50-day MA.
- DCA-out: Scheduled profit-taking on positions above targets.
- Multi-asset DCA: Allocate contributions proportionally; rebalance quarterly.

## Fees, spreads, and slippage
- Monthly cadence balances cost and volatility well for small accounts.
- Use limit orders to reduce slippage.
- Monitor all-in cost; optimize cadence or venue if above ~0.5–1.0%.

## Risk and behavior checklist
- Maintain emergency fund.
- Comfortable, unleveraged contribution size.
- Do not pause after price drops unless planned.
- Avoid leverage.

## Crypto and RWA angles
- Manage volatility with diversified custody and stablecoin inflows.
- Use tokenized T-bills for cash parking.
- Keep precise cost-basis records for taxes.

## Common mistakes to avoid
- Changing assets midstream without a plan.
- Overcomplicating with too many assets.
- Neglecting fees and rebalancing.
- Inconsistent dip buying (timing).

## FAQ
- Is DCA always better than lump sum? No; DCA lowers timing risk and stress.
- Weekly or monthly? Both work; monthly cheaper for small accounts.
- How long to DCA? Minimum 12–24 months; review annually.
