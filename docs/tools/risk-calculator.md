## Quick Risk Formulas

### Position Risk
```
Risk Amount = Position Size × Stop Distance × Point Value
```

### Portfolio Risk
```
Total Risk = Sum of all individual position risks
```

### Risk Percentage
```
Risk % = Risk Amount ÷ Account Balance × 100
```

## Best Practices

1. **Maximum Risk**: Keep total portfolio risk under 10%
2. **Individual Trades**: Risk max 1-2% per trade
3. **Correlation**: Avoid too many correlated positions
4. **Regular Review**: Reassess risk daily
