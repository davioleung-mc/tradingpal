## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a TradingPal visitor, I want to easily discover and access trading content through a clean, organized navigation structure that groups related information into logical categories, so I can quickly find relevant educational resources and market insights.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I visit the TradingPal homepage, **When** I look at the navigation, **Then** I see "Insights" and "Resources" as the main menu items with logo and search preserved
2. **Given** I hover over "Insights", **When** the submenu appears, **Then** I see "Market Analysis" and "Trading Strategy" options
3. **Given** I hover over "Resources", **When** the submenu appears, **Then** I see "Personal Finance Tips", "Tutorials", and "Useful Links" options
4. **Given** I am navigating the site, **When** I look for language options or GitHub links, **Then** these elements are not visible in the navigation
5. **Given** I want to access existing articles, **When** I navigate through Resources submenu, **Then** all current content is organized under either "Personal Finance Tips" or "Tutorials"
6. **Given** I access content through the new navigation, **When** I look at the URL, **Then** it reflects the hierarchical structure (e.g., /insights/market-analysis/, /resources/tutorials/)

### Edge Cases
- What happens when users bookmark old navigation URLs? [System should redirect or maintain content accessibility]
- How does search functionality work with the new organization? [Search remains functional and comprehensive]  
- What if users expect to find disclaimer in navigation? [Content remains accessible but not prominently featured in main nav]
- How are legacy URLs handled when structure changes? [Proper redirects maintain SEO and user experience]
- What happens to deeply nested content URLs? [URL structure should remain logical and not overly complex]
